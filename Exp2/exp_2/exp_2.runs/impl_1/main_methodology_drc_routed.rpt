LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell NC/_inferred__0/i_, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) NC/constant_reg[19]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell NC/constant_reg[13]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) NC/constant_reg[13]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell NC/constant_reg[16]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) NC/constant_reg[10]/CLR, NC/constant_reg[11]/PRE, NC/constant_reg[16]/CLR

Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell NC/constant_reg[16]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) NC/constant_reg[10]/PRE, NC/constant_reg[11]/CLR, NC/constant_reg[16]/PRE
NC/constant_reg[9]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#5 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell NC/constant_reg[20]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) NC/constant_reg[14]/PRE, NC/constant_reg[20]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
