2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net dec_reg[0]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin dec_reg[0]/L3_2/O, cell dec_reg[0]/L3_2 (in dec_reg[0] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net dec_reg[2]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin dec_reg[2]/L3_2/O, cell dec_reg[2]/L3_2 (in dec_reg[2] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net dec_reg[3]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin dec_reg[3]/L3_2/O, cell dec_reg[3]/L3_2 (in dec_reg[3] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
