2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net NC/constant_reg[10]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin NC/constant_reg[10]/L3_2/O, cell NC/constant_reg[10]/L3_2 (in NC/constant_reg[10] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net NC/constant_reg[11]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin NC/constant_reg[11]/L3_2/O, cell NC/constant_reg[11]/L3_2 (in NC/constant_reg[11] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net NC/constant_reg[13]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin NC/constant_reg[13]/L3_2/O, cell NC/constant_reg[13]/L3_2 (in NC/constant_reg[13] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net NC/constant_reg[16]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin NC/constant_reg[16]/L3_2/O, cell NC/constant_reg[16]/L3_2 (in NC/constant_reg[16] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net NC/constant_reg[19]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin NC/constant_reg[19]/L3_2/O, cell NC/constant_reg[19]/L3_2 (in NC/constant_reg[19] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net NC/constant_reg[20]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin NC/constant_reg[20]_i_1/O, cell NC/constant_reg[20]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net NC/constant_reg[9]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin NC/constant_reg[9]/L3_2/O, cell NC/constant_reg[9]/L3_2 (in NC/constant_reg[9] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
